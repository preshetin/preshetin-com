# Open Source

Here are some of my open-source contributions that I have made over the years.

## Serverless Framework
I have made quite big contributions (for me personally) to the core of the framework and was mentioned on the company's Twitter. You can find the tweet [here](https://twitter.com/goserverless/status/1290325382130999296). And here is the link to the PR itself: [serverless/serverless/pull/7335](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/7335).
