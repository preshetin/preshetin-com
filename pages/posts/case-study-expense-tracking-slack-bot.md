# Case Study: Slack Bot for Expense Tracking in a Non-Profit Organization

## Our Goal

As a small group of organizers conducting Vipassana meditation courses in our local region in Minsk, Belarus, we wanted to streamline our financial tracking process and improve communication within our team. Our main objective was to eliminate the need for multiple tools and achieve real-time updates on expenses and income.

## Project Details and Contribution

Previously, we used a bookkeeping tool called Drebedengi.ru to track donations and expenses, but it required us to visit a separate website, causing inconvenience and inefficiency. We also relied on Slack for team communication.

To address these challenges, I developed a Slack bot hosted on AWS Lambda. Written in TypeScript, the bot integrated with our Slack workspace and allowed us to track expenses and income directly within Slack. This eliminated the need for context switching and enhanced our workflow. Additionally, I implemented a feature where users could share income or expense updates to a dedicated public channel, ensuring transparency and keeping the entire team informed about our current financial situation.

## Project Success

The implementation of the Slack bot brought significant success to our non-profit organization. We now save valuable time when adding financial data, as we no longer have to navigate to a separate website. The real-time tracking within Slack provides us with immediate visibility into our financial status. Moreover, the dedicated public channel enables better collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members, fostering transparency and accountability.

## Future Opportunities

The Slack bot for expense tracking has proven to be a valuable tool for our non-profit organization. This case study showcases my ability to deliver customized solutions that enhance team productivity.
