# Case Study: Improving Meal and Purchasing Planning with Airtable and Custom Extension

## Introduction
This case study outlines a project that aimed to improve meal and purchasing planning for organizing meditation courses. The initial process relied on Google Sheets, which lacked flexibility and posed challenges when managing menus and making updates. The goal was to create a more efficient and error-free solution using Airtable and a custom extension.
