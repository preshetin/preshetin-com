# Case Study: Improving Meal and Purchasing Planning with Airtable and Custom Extension

## Introduction
This case study outlines a project that aimed to improve meal and purchasing planning for organizing meditation courses. The initial process relied on Google Sheets, which lacked flexibility and posed challenges when managing menus and making updates. The goal was to create a more efficient and error-free solution using Airtable and a custom extension.

## Client's Goal
The client, in this case, refers to the project owner and their team, who organized meditation courses and required a streamlined system for meal and purchasing planning. The primary objective was to enhance the existing process by introducing a more flexible and error-resistant solution. The desired outcome was to simplify meal management, enable easy menu printing for cooks, and facilitate purchasing planning for course organizers.

## Project Details
### My Contribution
My key contributions to the project included:

1. Airtable Database Creation: Designed and implemented an Airtable database consisting of three interconnected tables, enabling efficient meal planning, menu printing, and purchase list generation.

2. Custom Airtable Extension Development: Developed a custom Airtable extension that built upon the created database, serving as a user-friendly interface for printing menus and planning purchases.

### Skills and Deliverables
Skills and tools used:

- Google Sheets
- Migration
- TypeScript
- Database Design
- React
- Airtable

## Project Success
The project resulted in the following successes:

1. Enhanced Flexibility: The Airtable database provided a flexible framework for managing meals and menus, reducing the need for formula tweaking and minimizing errors.

2. Streamlined Processes: The custom Airtable extension simplified menu printing and purchasing planning, benefiting both cooks and course organizers.

3. Error Reduction: Transitioning to Airtable and utilizing the custom extension significantly reduced the chances of human errors, improving accuracy in the planning process.

In conclusion, the implementation of an Airtable database and a custom extension successfully improved meal and purchasing planning for meditation courses. The project resulted in enhanced flexibility, streamlined processes, and a notable reduction in errors.

## My Role
I created Airtable database and custom extension

## Project goal
The goal of this project was to improve meal and purchasing planning that was initially done with Google Sheets.

I practice meditation technique called Vipassana. Sometimes I volunteer in organising meditation courses where people can learn this technique.

Organising such a course involves meal and purchasing planning for about hundred people. To plan meals, Google Sheet was used.

The problem with Google Sheets was it did not provide flexibility when working with menu. For example, adding a new meal would involve manual formula tweaking in numerous places which is error-prone.

## Skills and deliverables
Google Sheets, Migration, TypeScript, Database Design, React, Airtable

## Solution
Airtable database was created. It contained of three tables that had relationships between each other. To address features like menu document printing and purchase list generation, I created custom Airtable extension.

To address the problem of easy meals management, I chose Airtable database. I created the structure of this database which involves relationships between tables.

As part of the solution, custom Airtable extension was developed. This extension was built on top of Airtable database. It enabled printing menu for a cook and planning purchasing for course organisers.
