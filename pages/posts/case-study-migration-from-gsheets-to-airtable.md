## My Role
I created Airtable database and custom extension

## Project goal
The goal of this project was to improve meal and purchasing planning that was initially done with Google Sheets.

I practice meditation technique called Vipassana. Sometimes I volunteer in organising meditation courses where people can learn this technique.

Organising such a course involves meal and purchasing planning for about hundred people. To plan meals, Google Sheet was used.

The problem with Google Sheets was it did not provide flexibility when working with menu. For example, adding a new meal would involve manual formula tweaking in numerous places which is error-prone.

## Skills and deliverables
Google Sheets, Migration, TypeScript, Database Design, React, Airtable

## Solution
Airtable database was created. It contained of three tables that had relationships between each other. To address features like menu document printing and purchase list generation, I created custom Airtable extension.

To address the problem of easy meals management, I chose Airtable database. I created the structure of this database which involves relationships between tables.

As part of the solution, custom Airtable extension was developed. This extension was built on top of Airtable database. It enabled printing menu for a cook and planning purchasing for course organisers.
