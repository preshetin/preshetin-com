# Case Study: Event Registration with Airtable

Airtable components: database, automations, Slack actionable messages, Gmail API.

This case study outline how I used Airtable to organize registration for an offline event, one day meditation courses.

## About

In Belarus, one day meditation courses are conducted on a mothly basis since 2017. 

## Process

Every month, an email campaing is sent via SendGrid. This campaign contains a link to Airtble. People apply for such course by fillling this Airtable form. 

Once a user fills the form, several things happen:
1. A user receives confirmation email saying that application is received. This email is sent by Airtable automation.
2. An organizer receives a Slack message with application data.

|:--:| 
| *Actionabe Slack message with application data is sent to organizer.* |

Once an organizer verifies the application he or she approves it. Once approved, the appicant receives another email with route details. This email is also gets sent with Airtable automation.
