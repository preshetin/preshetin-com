# Case Study: Simplifying Student Sitting Plans with a Miro App

I created a Miro app that helps with creating seating plans for Vipassana meditation courses. During my time as a manager for Vipassana courses, one of my responsibilities was to create a sitting plan for the students. This plan is essentially a sheet of paper with a scheme that determines where each student sits. Teachers and managers use this sitting plan to know the arrangement of students in the meditation hall.

## Problem

Previously, an Excel spreadsheet was used to create the seating plan. While it served its purpose, it presented some challenges when changes were required. For instance, if the student scheme in the meditation hall changed (which could happen in non-standard meditation halls), the Excel file had to be manually updated. This involved changing formulas in multiple places. For instance, modifying the number of students per row required updating almost all formulas to fit the new hall structure.

## Solution

To address this problem, I developed a small app based on the Miro workspace. This app takes the list of students as input and allows easy configuration of the number of students sitting per row. Additionally, the app provides the option to translate student names into another language. This feature is particularly helpful for teachers who prefer having the seating plan in their native language.

I tested this app on a few courses a couple of months ago and can confirm that it makes creating seating plans much easier and more efficient.
